Hi, 

I "vibe coded" this using Claude AI at a Hacklahoma event. At said event the pokémon didnt show up :( but once I downloaded the app it worked as intended. 

Anyway here is my app completely written by Claude AI. It's pretty cool to see what different AI models can do. I will have to try out different projects in the future. 

I chose Gens 1 and 2 as I am playing to Pokémon HeartGold at the moment. 

Of course all rights belong to Nintendo/GameFreak/The Pokémon Company.

Thanks for reading,

Thomas
